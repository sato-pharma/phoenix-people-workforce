// Store sales, split evenly across the areas of the store's city.
//
// THE RULE (owner, 2026-08-04). A wholesaler/warehouse customer — a STORE, see
// src/lib/sales/customer-channel.ts — does not sell only into the area it physically sits in. It
// supplies the whole city. So crediting 100% of its sell-in to the one rep whose area happens to
// contain it overstates that rep and understates every colleague in the same city. Instead: take
// the store's sales PER PRODUCT PER MONTH and divide them EVENLY across the AREAS of that store's
// city. Each area's share then reaches whoever holds that area's line seat through the existing
// attribution; a vacant seat keeps its share on the area, exactly as the closing already handles
// vacancies.
//
// WHY THE AREA AND NOT THE REP. Dividing by rep headcount looks equivalent and is not: 20
// city×line pairs have NO rep at all (Cairo has no Pedia rep anywhere), so a headcount divisor is
// zero and the money would have nowhere to go. Areas always exist, so the area divisor is never
// zero and the total is always preserved.
//
// SCOPE. Pedia / Anti Infective / CNS only — Head Office is deliberately excluded (it is 93% of
// store value and has no rep line at all; the owner is handling it separately). Pharmacies are
// untouched. Direct rows carry no area and are already attributed to line+region only, so they
// are passed through untouched too.
