-- The Monthly Closing's channel BREAKDOWN, on the shared rule — the last copy.
--
-- Same defect as its sibling in the migration beside this one, and the same fix: the five-question
-- CASE becomes one call to `phx_customer_channel`, which holds the whole rule. Everything else in
-- this function is untouched, and deliberately so — the seating join, the July direct-area floor,
-- the brick/area grid and the population reconciliation are not classification and are not this
-- change's business.
--
-- THE THREE BUCKETS ABOVE THE CHANNEL STAY ABOVE IT: a direct row with no customer name, a row with
-- no client code, a row with no name. They answer "we do not know who this is", which is not a
-- channel, and the classifier would call every one of them a pharmacy.
--
-- An empty payload rebuilds the pre-2026-09-07 rule from the array parameters, so the function's
-- answer does not change until the deploy that sends the payload is live. Verified on production
-- immediately after applying, by digest, on three line/period combinations.
