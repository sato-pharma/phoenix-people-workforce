-- WHAT:     The two CRM read doors stop building Phoenix CRM's entry days for a read that cannot need them.
--             1. crm_visits_unified  — its iReports360 rows are read in two runs: the days before Phoenix CRM's
--                first day (the earliest team start, or its earlier day_activities_from), where no rep can have
--                a Phoenix entry and "Phoenix wins the day" is not asked, and the days from it, which keep both
--                checks word for word. The entry days are built once per read, shared by the two checks.
--             2. crm_checkins_unified — the same, on the check-in's wall-clock day.
--           Every row each door returns is unchanged — measured on production on 2026-10-19: 143,073
--           iReports360 visit rows and 136,539 iReports360 check-ins before and after, none differing — and so
--           is every column, its name, type and order. phoenix_crm_rep_entry_days() and both Phoenix branches
--           are not touched.
-- WHY:      Since 20261016201551 every read of either door ran phoenix_crm_rep_entry_days() twice, and each run
--           rebuilds every Phoenix entry day from all of Phoenix CRM's history (14,282 buffers, 40 ms on
--           2026-10-19, growing with every visit logged) — on a July day too, where it can match nothing. On
--           2026-10-19 those reads were under 2% of the database's calls and 47% of its time, and the
--           Approvals hub's manager plan queue timed out behind them. Measured the same day: one day's visits
--           of 12 August cost 25,063 buffers and 90 ms before, 624 buffers and 9 ms after. A day from
--           3 October on costs one build instead of two.
-- ROLLBACK: re-apply sections 2 and 3 of 20261016201551_phoenix_crm_wins_the_day_for_medical_reps.sql with
--           create or replace view. No data is touched by this migration.
