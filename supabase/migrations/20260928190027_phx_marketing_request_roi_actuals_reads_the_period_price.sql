-- phx_marketing_request_roi_actuals_reads_the_period_price
--
-- WHAT THIS CHANGES: `public.phx_marketing_request_roi_actuals` now takes its factory price from
--   public.phx_factory_price(product_code, period) instead of reading
--   source_of_sales_products.factory_price straight off the product master. Byte-identical to the
--   body on production apart from that one expression, and only where it VALUES a row.
--
-- WHY: owner instruction 2026-09-28, repricing Saginko — direct orders from that day, "the sales
--   and target of the retail to be adjusted from 1 October". The resolver falls back to the master
--   price when no override covers the period, so a product without an override row is valued
--   exactly as before and this file moves no number on its own. Rationale, the override table and
--   the resolver: 20260928184100_period_scoped_factory_prices.sql.
--
--   One function per file on purpose: several guards in tests/ resolve "the newest migration that
--   defines X" and then read that whole file, so a bundle of 31 functions makes one function's SQL
--   answer for another's.
--
-- ROLLBACK: re-apply the previous definition. The cheaper undo is to drop the override row —
--   delete from public.source_of_sales_product_price_history where product_code = 'SA001';
--   which restores the old valuation everywhere without touching a function.
