-- phoenix_crm_still_planned_after_one_day_return
--
-- WHAT THIS CHANGES (owner ruling, 2026-10-02 — "Still planned"): after a reviewer returns ONE day of a
-- sent week, the rep's visits on the OTHER days of that week still count as PLANNED; only the returned
-- day waits for him to send the week again.
--
--   1. phoenix_crm_save_visit — its live body (20260929235553_phoenix_crm_one_tap_visit.sql, identical to
--      production: md5(pg_get_functiondef) 9d81ce6d907a3535a7a08f368aa0c025) with ONE change, inside
--      "WAS HE PLANNED?" (v_on_sent_plan) and nowhere else. The test that was there stays word for word
--      — the latest plan event as of captured_at reaching 'submitted' or 'approved' — and a second
--      branch is added beside it: the latest event is the one-day return ('returned', with returned_day
--      in its details) and the visit is on ANOTHER day of the week. A one-day return stops counting once
--      an edit request is acknowledged after it, because that acknowledgement opens the whole week to
--      the rep (plan-rules.ts standingReturnedDay) and a day he can change is never authority.
--
--   2. phoenix_crm_plan_transition — restated, because two migrations replaced it from the same base and
--      whichever ran last silently dropped the other's change:
--        20261002120049_phoenix_crm_plan_review.sql   the one-day return, and the copy each send keeps
--        20261002122000_phoenix_crm_plan_deadline_2355.sql   lateness read from the 23:55 deadline
--      Production and staging both run 20261002122000's body today (md5(prosrc)
--      ee5b3f2f04541f99a92b4ca61ae079d2), which never reads the day: a one-day return sent to it would
--      return the WHOLE week, and a send would leave a stored returned_day behind for the CHECK to
--      refuse. This is that live body with 20261002120049's changes applied and nothing else: v_day and
--      v_details, the bad_input and day_not_returnable checks, returned_day set on a one-day return and
--      cleared by a send or a reopen, the snapshot each send keeps on its own event, and the event
--      insert carrying details — still ONE plan-event insert.
--
-- WHAT DOES NOT CHANGE:
--   phoenix_crm_report_plan_vs_actual is NOT replaced. Its sent_days already reads a RETURNED week as
--   sent on every one of its days — the latest event by the end of that Cairo day in ('submitted',
--   'approved', 'returned') — so every day of a one-day-returned week other than the returned day
--   already reads as sent, and replacing it would change nothing (live md5(pg_get_functiondef)
--   b558afb9baeb77b39b8008d4a5ea3df3, the body of 20260926163000).
--   Every other line of both functions is the live text, byte for byte. No table, column, view, grant
--   or policy changes; phoenix_crm_plans.returned_day and its CHECK come from 20261002120049.
--
-- WHY: owner, 2026-10-02, asked whether visits on the days a one-day return left as sent should wait for
--   the resend too, and chose "Still planned": only the returned day waits.
--
-- ROLLBACK:
--   phoenix_crm_save_visit: re-apply its body from 20260929235553 (section 4) — every visit already
--   saved keeps the is_unplanned it was stamped with; only visits saved after that read the old rule.
--   phoenix_crm_plan_transition: re-apply THIS file's body without the one-day return only by writing it
--   out — never 20261002120049 alone (it drops the 23:55 deadline) and never 20261002122000 alone while a
--   week carries returned_day (that week's resend would leave the day set and the CHECK then refuses it).
--
-- Production has NO point-in-time recovery — 7 daily backups are the whole recovery story.
-- Anything destructive or bulk is announced to the owner in plain words BEFORE it is applied.
